 Sure! Here are my recommendations and guidelines for NLP learners:

1. Book recommendation:

For beginners, I highly recommend "Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to NLP using Python, covering topics such as text processing, feature extraction, and machine learning. It's an excellent resource for both theory and practical implementation.

For advanced learners, I suggest "Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" by Yoav Goldberg. This book covers cutting-edge techniques in NLP, including word embeddings, language modeling, and sequence-to-sequence models. It's a great resource for those looking to dive deeper into the field and explore recent advancements.

1. Website recommendation:

The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group's tutorial page (https://www.stanfordnlp.org/tutorials/) is an excellent resource for NLP learners. It offers a wide range of tutorials on various NLP topics, from basics like tokenization and stemming to more advanced concepts like dependency parsing and coreference resolution. The site also provides datasets for practice, including the popular Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.

Another useful website is Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/), a platform for data science competitions and hosting datasets. They have numerous NLP datasets available for practice, along with tutorials and notebooks submitted by the community.
